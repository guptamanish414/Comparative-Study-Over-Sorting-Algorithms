Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually,
 either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort,
 and is a cousin of radix sort in the most to least significant digit flavour. Bucket sort is a generalization of pigeonhole sort. Since bucket sort is not a comparison sort, 
the O(n log n) lower bound is inapplicable. 
The computational complexity estimates involve the number of buckets.
Bucket sort works as follows:
Set up an array of initially empty "buckets."
Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each object in its bucket.
Sort each non-empty bucket.
Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array.
