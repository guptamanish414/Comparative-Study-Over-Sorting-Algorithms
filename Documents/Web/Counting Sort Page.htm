	<h2 align="center">The <i>Counting Sort</i> Algorithm</h2><br><br>

	<p>Counting Sort works by counting the occurrences of each data value. It assumes that there are <i>n</i> data items in the range of 1..<i>k</i>, where <i>k</i>
 is an integer. The algorithm can then determine, for each input 
element, the amount of elements less than it. For example if there are 9
 elements less than element <i>x</i>, then <i>x</i> belongs in the 10th data position.
	</p>
<br><br>
	The pseudocode Counting Sort algorithm is as follows:
	<br><br>
	<font face="Courier"><pre>      countingsort(A[], B[], k)
	for i = 1 to k do
	   C[i] = 0
	   
	for j = 1 to length(A) do
	   C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1
	   
	for 2 = 1 to k do
	   C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1]

	for j = 1 to length(A) do
	   B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
	   C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] - 1

	</pre></font>   
	<p>Although this may look complicated, it is actually a very simple and clever algorithm.<br><br>
	Array A[ ] stores the initial data to be sorted.<br><br>
	Array C[ ] is used to count the occurrences of the data values<br><br>
	Array B[ ] is used to store the final, sorted, list.<br><br>
	The first for loop initialises C[ ] top zero.<br>
	The second for loop increments the values in C[], according to their frequencies in the data.<br>
	The third for loop adds all previous values, making C[] contain a cumulative total.<br>
	The fourth for loop writes out the sorted data into array B[].<br><br>
	<br>Two of the for loops take O(k) time, and two take O(n) time. An 
important point to note is that Counting Sort is stable: All elements of
 the same value will appear in the <b>same order</b> in the output array array that they do in the input array.
